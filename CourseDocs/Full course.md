***An Introduction to Zulu Language:***

The language isiZulu is widely spoken in all over South Africa. It is one of the Nguni languages, related to Xhosa, SiSwati and Ndebele. The Nguni language structure is based on a system of noun classes and a system of concords. In order to help those who are willing to learn Nguni language, lessons have been prepared; and the following lessons are specifically based on Zulu language. In Zulu all words end in a vowel {**a, e, i, o, u**} and a word written or spoken as e.g***. umfaan*** is incorrect it should be ***umfana**.*

***LESSON 1: A GUIDE TO PRONUNCIATION:***

Zulu employs European alphabets. Some of the sounds of Zulu, however, cannot be catered for by alphabet, and another unusual feature is the use of clicks of which there are three in Zulu. Whereas in English some letters may have differing pronunciations, e.g. the letter ‘***a***’ in the words: man, may, mar the Zulu pronunciations, which are itemized below, are generally constant.

***Vowels***  
***A***  as in ‘far’ Examples: vala {shut} lala {sleep} umfana {boy}  
***E***  as in ‘wet’ Examples: geza {wash} sebenza {work} yebo {yes}  
***I***  as in ‘inn’ Examples: biza {call} siza {help} ngi {I, me} fika {arrive}  
**O** as in ‘ore’ {never as in ‘hope’ as often mistakenly pronounced by White} Examples: bona {see} izolo {yesterday} into {thing}  
***U***  as in ‘full’ Examples: vula {open} funa {want} umuntu {person}

***Semi-vowels***

***y***	is pronounced as in English word “yeast” e.g. uyise {his/her father}  
***w***	is pronounced as in the English word “well” e.g. amawele {twins}

***Consonants***

***b***	this is soft “***b***” sound pronounced with bilabial implosion, e.g. ubaba  
{my / our father}; bala {count}  
***bh***  this is hard “***b***” sound pronounced as in the English word “bed”.  
This is bilabial explosive sound e.g. bhala {write}; ibhala {a barrow}.  
***c***  this is a click sound.it is a sound sometimes made in English to express exasperation .  
The sound is made by pressing the tip of the tongue  
against the forepart of the upper mouth, and then withdrawing it, e.g. cela

{ask} ceba {to inform against}.  
***ch*** this is the “***e***” sound aspirated, e.g. chela {sprinkle with water}: ichibi {pond}  
***d***	this is pronounced as in the English “dark,” e.g idada {duck}; deka {lay the table}.

e.g. dlala {play}.

6. is pronounced as in the English word “fair,” e.g. faka {put in}. funa {want}  
7. is pronounced as in the English words “golf” “gather”.It is never given the “***g***” sound as in the word “gentle,” e.g. goba {bend}: igama {name/word}.

   {bury}  
   ***gx*** this is voiced combination of the “***g***” sound and the click sound “***x***” e.g. gxagxaza  
   {leak very much}  
8. in some words this is pronounced as in English word “hand” and in others as in the Afrikaans word “hand”.{The double “***h***” for the second “***h***” sound is no longer used},e.g. hamba {go}; ihhashi {horse}.  
   ***hl***  it has no equivalent in English e.g. hlaba {stab}, hlala {sit}  
10. this is pronounced as in the English word “jig,” e.g. jika {make a turn }  
11. this is pronounced as in the English word “scheme” e.g. ikati {cat}.  
    In many Zulu words “***k***” represents softer sound than this,something between *a* “***k***”and a “***g***”, e.g. ukuma {to stand} uThukela {Thukela river}.  
    ***kh***	this is an aspirated sound. It is pronounced rather like the “***c***” in the English word “comb,” e.g. ukhezo {spoon}.

18. the “***r***” as pronounced in English words does not occur in Zulu. It is now found in a number of imported words, e.g. irayisi {rice}.
